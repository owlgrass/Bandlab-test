# bandlab-test

Take home assignment for Bandlab's Junior Front-End Developer role.

## Setup

Use regular webserver to serve the `./index.html`, or something like NPM `reload` package.

## Implementation

Vue 3 runtime compilation is used.

For simplicity:

- Each page runs a separate Vue app
- The pages are referred to as `/blog` and `/audio`
